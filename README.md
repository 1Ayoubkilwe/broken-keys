## Count characters in string

##### Your Task ðŸ“š:

Create a function called `count` that takes two strings as arguments and returns the
number of times the first string (the single character) is found in the second string.

##### Examples ðŸ˜ƒ:

```
count("a", "fikrcamp") âžž 1
count("c", "bootcamp") âžž 1
count("o", "fikrcamp coding bootcamp") âžž 3
```

Good Luck ðŸ˜€
