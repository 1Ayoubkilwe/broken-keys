## Pluralize

##### Your Task ðŸ“š:

Create a function called `pluralize` that passes a list of words in the singular form, return a set of those words in the plural form if they appear more than once in the list.
Note: just add 's' to the end of the word

##### Examples ðŸ˜ƒ:

```
pluralize(["cat","dog","cat","mouse"]) âžž ["cats","dog","mouse"]
pluralize(["car", "car", "car"]) âžž ["cars"]
```

Good Luck ðŸ˜€
