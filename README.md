## Largest number in groups

##### Your Task 📚:

Create a called `findLargestNumbers` function that takes an array of arrays with numbers. Return a new (single) array with the largest numbers of each.

##### Examples 😃:

```
findLargestNumbers([[7, 3, 8, 11], [54, 12, 43, 77], [16, 11, 8]]) ➞ [11, 77, 16]
findLargestNumbers([[22, 55, 12], [45, 66, 95], [22, 5, 11]]) ➞ [55, 95, 22]
```

Good Luck 😀
